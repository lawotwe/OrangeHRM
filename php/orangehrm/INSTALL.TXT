      extensions)


Firstly Install Apache HTTP Server by following these steps;
  Accept the license agreement and press next
  Press next again after reading about Apache HTTP Server
  When promted fordetails about; Network Domain,  Server Name, etc., use the values below :

    Network Domain: 	localhost
    Server Name:		localhost
    Admin. Email:	        <your Email-id>

  press next
  If you are installing Apache HTTP server 2, then 
  Select Install Apache HTTP Server 2.0 as a Service. 
  Choose custom installation.
  change path of apache to directory 
    c:\apache\

Install server 

Note: In case you are using a firewall software, please make sure the you give (allow) 
      access to Apache HTTP server. 

Secondly you have to install PHP;

  unzip the PHP4 package you downloaded into directory 
  c:\php\

Then open the file in the apache installation directory 
  c:\apache\Apache\conf\httpd.conf


  Search for keyword DocumentRoot, used to point to the server that contains the OrangeHRM 
  source files. Therefore it shall be set to folder that contains the source files.
  Make sure it is of the format 
    DocumentRoot “c:/apache/Apache/htdocs/” 
			
Note: the path should be specified using forward slashes instead of black slashes as in
      windows paths

  Then goto the area where the LoadModule tags are defined. 
  In the list there should be one line that reads as 
    LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

  Remove the leading '#' char to make the line active
  Goto the end of LoadModule section 

If you are using Apache HTTP server ver 1.3.xx  add line
  LoadModule php4_module “c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll”

Then at the end of AddModule section add line 
  AddModule mod_php4.c

If you are using Apache HTTP server ver 2.0.xx  add line
  LoadModule php4_module  “c:/php/sapi/php4apache2.dll”

Then at the end of AddType section add line
  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Now to set starting page of OrangeHRM as login.php search for DirectoryIndex 
and alter it so that login.php is nearest to DirectoryIndex on line
  DirectoryIndex login.php index.htm ....
Save and close httpd.conf

Now goto c:\php\ directory and open file c:\php\php.ini
Note: if the php.ini file does not exist then rename exisiting file php.ini-dist 
      as php.ini and open it

Find these key-words in it and change them if required

  error_reporting = E_ALL
  display_errors = On
  extension_dir = “c:\php\extensions”

Save & close php.ini

Now copy files as below;
  copy all files in directory  c:\php\dlls into c:\windows\system32
  copy file c:\php\php4ts.dll into c:\windows\system32
  copy file php.ini into both c:\windows\system32 and c:\windows\

Restart windows

Start installing MySQL server

  Double-click the setup.exe file to start the installation.
  The Setup Wizard panel is displayed.
  Click Next.
  
  Select Custom Install and click Next.
  Expand the Developer Components and select “Scripts.Examples” to run from your hard drive
  Change installation  directory to C:\MySQL 
  Click next

  When promted to signup for MySql.com account select skip sign-up, press next.
  The installation setup wizard is complete, leave the checkmark next to the field, 
  Configure the MySQL Server now. 
  Click Finish.

  Click Next to begin the configuration process, accept the default value of 
  Detailed Configuration for the configuration type 
  click Next.

  Select Sever Machine for the server type and click Next.

  Select Transactional Database Only for the database usage  and click Next.
  For the InnoDB Tablespace Settings, select MySQL Datafiles from the dropdown list  
  Click Next.

  Select Manual Setting for the number of concurrent connections.Set this value to 5 
  (depending on  number clients using the application)

  and click Next.

  Accept the default value of Standard Character Set for the default character set 
  and click Next.

  Accept the default value of Install as Windows Service for the Windows. 
  You may explicitly identify which version of MySQL is running 
  (you need not worry if you are having only single MySQL server)

  Check the box to  Include Bin Directory in Windows.
  Click Next.

  Always select a new root password when you install MySQL for the first time.
  That is because MySQL normally has no password in Windows which allows anyone to 
  access the database. Make sure you remember what the password is. 
  Remove the check mark next to the Anonymous Account.
  Click Next.

  All of the information required by the configuration wizard is complete.
  Click the Execute button to begin the actual configuration. 
  After all the status messages are issued, click the Finish button.

   
  Assuming a properly configured PHP/Apache/MySQL system, that is;
 
  An exisiting MySQL server (ver 4.1 or later) existing as a localhost or as a remote server 
  linked with the application hosting machine with a user account with privledges to 
  create user accounts, databases, tables, etc.

  Apache HTTP server (ver 1.3 or later)

  PHP (ver 4.3.0, later versions supported but not tested). 
  It should be installed with all PHP plugins running as Apache modules and not as a 
  CGI interpreter.

For Linux Installation these steps should be followed;

  1. Retrieve the PHP source of OrangeHRM onto the directory that is configured as 
     Apache Server htdocs directory; ex: /var/html/orangehrm/  
  2. change the owner & group of the source directory (and all files and sub-directories 
     within it)
     ex: /var/html/orangehrm/;  to apache. 
  3. In the MySQL server create a user account with all priviledges, 
     please note down the username and password since it will be required to configure the 
     application to give it access to the database in step (5). 
  4. Create the database using the script dbscript.sql residing in orangehrm/dbscript 
     directory. 
  5. Then you have to configure the application to give the authentication information it 
     requires to access MySQL server. To do this edit file orangehrm/lib/Confs/Conf.php as
     set the following parameters;
 
            $this->dbhost = '<IP address of MySQL server>';
            $this->dbport  = '<port no, of MySQL server>';
            $this->dbuser = '<username>';    the user name of the account you created 
            $this->dbpass = '<password>';    the user name of the account you created 
            $this->smtphost = '<SMTP server DNS or IP address>'; the DNS or IP address

  6. Start or restart Apache server

 
 
For Windows Installation these steps should be followed;

  1. Extract the PHP source of OrangeHRM onto the directory that is configured as 
     Apache Server htdocs directory; ex: c:\apache\Apache\htdocs\orangehrm\ 
  2. You need to create the database using the script dbscript.sql residing in 
     c:\apache\Apache\htdocs \orangehrm\dbscript directory. Goto this directory first, 
     then relevant command is as follows, first goto  mysql command prompt login in as root
     of MySQL server. Then type in command
     source dbscript.sql
  3. In the MySQL server create a user account with all priviledges,
     please note down the username and password since it will be required to configure the
     application to give it access to the database in step (4). 
     Use the commands as follows;

     grant all privileges on hr_mysql.* to '<username>'@'%'  identified by '<password>' with grant option;

     SET PASSWORD FOR '<username>'@'%' = OLD_PASSWORD('<password>');

  4. You have to configure the application to give the authentication information it requires to access MySQL server. To do this edit file c:\apache\Apache\htdocs\orangehrm\lib\Confs\Conf.php as set the following parameters;
 
            $this->dbhost = '<IP address of MySQL server>';
            $this->dbport  = '<port no, of MySQL server>';
            $this->dbuser = '<username>';    the user name of the account you created 
            $this->dbpass = '<password>';    the user name of the account you created 
            $this->smtphost = '<SMTP server DNS or IP address>'; the DNS or IP address
