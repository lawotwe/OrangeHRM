New & Changed Features for OrangeHRM ver 1.0 (15/03/2006)

New Features

	- PIM (employee photograph/Report To)
	- ESS 
	- Reports

	PIM;
	
	* Employee Information now contains the facility to maintain the employee's photograph. 
	  Employee photograph could be included (not mandatory) while an employee is added to 
	  Employee Information and can also be updated (replaced) with latest photographs in edit mode.
	
	* Report To 
	  This feature allows to define the ‘report to’ hierarchy of all employees (supervisors/subordinates) 
	  and reporting type (direct/indirect); On selecting an employee, all the supervisors/subordinates 
	  assigned to that employee will be listed separately at the bottom of the page. To add a new supervisor/subordinate,
	  simply select the supervisor/subordinate from the pop-up window that can be opened by clicking on the button next 
	  to the 'Employee ID' field. The reporting method should also be selected as : direct/indirect. To edit an existing 
	  supervisor/subordinate, click on the Employee ID of the relevant supervisor/subordinate in the lists below
	  and make the necessary changes. To un-assign a supervisor/subordinate, simply delete the supervisor/subordinate
 	  from the relevant list.
	 
	
	ESS
		Employee Self Service facilitates employees to edit their own personal data without the 
		intervention of the HR Department. However, sensitive data would only be displayed and would
		not be editable using ESS. If the user logged in is not a HR Admin user, then the user will be 
	 	presented with this module with his/her employee information enabling them to edit their personal
		data. (sensitive data such as salary grade, corporate tile, etc. will remain read-only).
		
		Note: 	All users are now classified as normal users and HR admin users. A user is 
		considered as HR Admin if the HR Admin checkbox is selected in the user creation form 
		under maintenance module. All other employees are considered as ordinary users.
	
	Reports
		This feature produces customized reports (users will be able define report criteria and result fields).
		Different reports can be defined and stored. Reports can be generated after providing the report criteria.
		Reports can only be generated by users who belong to user groups assigned to view those reports at the 
		time of report definition.
		
		The ability to define reports depends on the user group of the currently logged on user.  If the user
		group of the currently logged on user is allowed to define reports, then the user will be displayed with
		a separate tab on the sub-menu to define reports. When defining reports, a set of selection criteria and
		report fields will be provided to the user. Users can name the report, select the relevant criteria and
		required fields. After saving the reports, the user will then be asked to assign user groups to the reports. 
		Only users belonging to the assigned user groups will be able to view reports. User-groups can also be assigned 
		and removed at a later time once the report has been defined. This can be done by selecting reports and clicking 
		on Assign User Groups to go to the Assign User Groups page. 
		
		To view a report, click on View Reports in the sub-menu and then select the report from the list. Depending upon
		the criteria defined for the report, you will be asked to enter criteria data required to generate the report. 
		To summarize the report you can de-select fields (only the selected criteria and fields during report definition 
		would appear in this form) and click on Generate Report.
